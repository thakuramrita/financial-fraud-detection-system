## Issue Title:
Implement Comprehensive Model Building, Evaluation, and Prediction Pipeline

## Issue Body:

### Overview
Implement a complete machine learning pipeline for the Financial Fraud Detection System, including model training, evaluation, and prediction capabilities with production-ready features.

### Key Tasks

#### 1. Model Building Pipeline
- [ ] Implement data preprocessing and validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive feature engineering pipeline
- [ ] Train multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network, SVM)
- [ ] Add hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
- [ ] Handle class imbalance with SMOTE/class weights

#### 2. Model Evaluation Framework
- [ ] Implement performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC)
- [ ] Create model validation strategies (k-fold, time-based, out-of-time)
- [ ] Integrate SHAP and LIME for explainability
- [ ] Generate evaluation reports and visualizations

#### 3. Prediction Pipeline
- [ ] Create FastAPI endpoints for real-time predictions
- [ ] Implement batch prediction capability
- [ ] Add model versioning and A/B testing
- [ ] Set up monitoring for latency and model drift

#### 4. Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement ensemble methods (voting, stacking)
- [ ] Add online learning capabilities
- [ ] Integrate LLM/LangChain for context-aware decisions

### Success Criteria
- Performance: >0.95 ROC-AUC on test set
- Latency: <100ms for real-time predictions
- Explainability: 100% prediction coverage
- Scalability: 1000+ requests/second

### Technical Stack
- Python 3.8+, scikit-learn, XGBoost, FastAPI
- SHAP/LIME for explainability
- Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring
