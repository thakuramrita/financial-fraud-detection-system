# Issue: Implement SHAP-based Model Interpretation for Fraud Detection

## üìã Issue Summary

**Title:** Implement SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for Model Interpretation in Fraud Detection System

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `ml-explainability`, `high-priority`, `good-first-issue`

**Assignees:** TBD

**Milestone:** Model Explainability & Interpretability

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

The current fraud detection system trains multiple ML models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Network) but lacks **model interpretability** functionality. While the system can predict fraudulent transactions, it cannot explain:

- **Why** a specific transaction was flagged as fraud
- **Which features** contributed most to the prediction
- **How** different feature values affect the model's decision
- **What** would need to change for a different prediction

This lack of interpretability creates issues with:
- **Regulatory compliance** (explainable AI requirements)
- **Business trust** (stakeholders need to understand model decisions)
- **Model debugging** (difficult to identify biased or incorrect feature importance)
- **Feature engineering** (can't optimize features without understanding their impact)

---

## üîß Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Already Available
- **SHAP dependency**: Already included in `requirements.txt` (`shap>=0.41.0`)
- **Trained models**: Multiple ML models trained with `FraudDetectionModelTrainer`
- **Feature engineering**: Preprocessing pipeline with scaling and encoding
- **Model persistence**: Models saved with joblib for reuse
- **Evaluation metrics**: AUC, precision, recall, confusion matrices

### ‚ùå What's Missing
- **SHAP integration**: No explainability implementation
- **Model interpretation API**: No endpoints for explanations
- **Visualization tools**: No SHAP plots or interactive dashboards
- **Feature importance analysis**: No systematic feature impact analysis
- **Explanation persistence**: No storage for generated explanations

---

## üöÄ Proposed Solution

### 1. Core Implementation - `src/models/explainability.py`

Create a comprehensive SHAP integration module with:

#### **SHAP Explainer Factory**
```python
class SHAPExplainerFactory:
    """Factory for creating appropriate SHAP explainers based on model type"""
    
    @staticmethod
    def create_explainer(model, X_train, model_type):
        """Create appropriate SHAP explainer"""
        if model_type in ['random_forest', 'gradient_boosting']:
            return shap.TreeExplainer(model)
        elif model_type in ['logistic_regression', 'svm']:
            return shap.LinearExplainer(model, X_train)
        elif model_type == 'neural_network':
            return shap.DeepExplainer(model, X_train)
        else:
            return shap.KernelExplainer(model.predict, X_train)
```

#### **Model Interpretation Engine**
```python
class FraudModelInterpreter:
    """Main class for generating SHAP explanations"""
    
    def __init__(self, model_path, preprocessing_path, model_type):
        """Initialize interpreter with trained model"""
        
    def explain_prediction(self, transaction_data):
        """Generate SHAP explanation for single prediction"""
        
    def explain_batch(self, transactions):
        """Generate SHAP explanations for batch of transactions"""
        
    def get_feature_importance(self, X_test):
        """Get global feature importance using SHAP"""
        
    def generate_waterfall_plot(self, transaction_data):
        """Generate SHAP waterfall plot for single prediction"""
        
    def generate_summary_plot(self, X_test):
        """Generate SHAP summary plot for feature importance"""
        
    def generate_dependence_plot(self, feature_name, X_test):
        """Generate SHAP dependence plot for specific feature"""
```

### 2. API Integration - `src/api/routes/explanations.py`

Add FastAPI endpoints for model explanations:

```python
@router.post("/explain/single")
async def explain_single_prediction(request: TransactionExplanationRequest):
    """Get SHAP explanation for single transaction"""
    
@router.post("/explain/batch")
async def explain_batch_predictions(request: BatchExplanationRequest):
    """Get SHAP explanations for multiple transactions"""
    
@router.get("/explain/feature-importance/{model_name}")
async def get_feature_importance(model_name: str):
    """Get global feature importance for specific model"""
    
@router.get("/explain/plots/{model_name}")
async def generate_explanation_plots(model_name: str):
    """Generate SHAP visualization plots"""
```

### 3. Enhanced Model Training - Update `model_trainer.py`

Integrate SHAP explanation generation into training pipeline:

```python
def train_models_with_explanations(self, X, y):
    """Enhanced training with SHAP explanations"""
    # ... existing training code ...
    
    # Generate SHAP explanations for each model
    for model_name, model in self.models.items():
        interpreter = FraudModelInterpreter(model, model_name)
        
        # Generate global feature importance
        feature_importance = interpreter.get_feature_importance(X_test)
        
        # Save explanation artifacts
        self.save_explanation_artifacts(model_name, interpreter, feature_importance)
```

### 4. Visualization Dashboard - `src/dashboard/explanations.py`

Create interactive SHAP visualization dashboard:

```python
class SHAPDashboard:
    """Interactive dashboard for SHAP explanations"""
    
    def create_feature_importance_dashboard(self):
        """Create interactive feature importance plots"""
        
    def create_prediction_explanation_dashboard(self):
        """Create dashboard for explaining individual predictions"""
        
    def create_model_comparison_dashboard(self):
        """Compare SHAP explanations across different models"""
```
