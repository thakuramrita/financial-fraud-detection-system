# Feature Engineering

## Summary

Add comprehensive feature engineering to improve model performance.

## Tasks

- [ ] Audit existing dataset to determine candidate features
- [ ] Engineer new features (date parts, ratios, interaction terms)
- [ ] Implement preprocessing (imputation, encoding, scaling)
- [ ] Integrate feature logic into data pipeline
- [ ] Update unit tests & docs

## Acceptance Criteria

- New features reproducible via pipeline
- Tests pass
- Performance metrics show improvement or rationale documented
