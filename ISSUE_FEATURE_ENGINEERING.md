# Issue: Implement Advanced Feature Engineering Pipeline for Fraud Detection

## Summary
Develop a comprehensive feature engineering pipeline to extract meaningful features from raw transaction data, improving fraud detection model performance through domain-specific transformations, aggregations, and behavioral pattern detection.

## Background
The current fraud detection system generates synthetic transaction data with basic features (amount, merchant_category, location, device_type, etc.) but lacks advanced feature engineering capabilities. The main.py file mentions feature engineering as a next step, but the `src/features/feature_engineering.py` module doesn't exist yet. Advanced features are crucial for capturing complex fraud patterns and improving model accuracy.

## Problem Statement
- **Missing Feature Engineering Module**: The `feature_engineering.py` file referenced in main.py doesn't exist
- **Limited Raw Features**: Current system only uses basic transaction attributes
- **No Behavioral Features**: Missing user behavior patterns, velocity checks, and anomaly scores
- **No Time-based Aggregations**: Lacking rolling window statistics and temporal patterns
- **No Cross-feature Interactions**: Missing feature combinations that could reveal fraud patterns
- **Poor Feature Scaling**: No standardization or normalization pipeline

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Create Core Feature Engineering Module
```python
class FeatureEngineer:
    """
    Advanced feature engineering pipeline for fraud detection.
    """
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any] = None):
        self.config = config or self.default_config()
        self.feature_metadata = {}
        self.scaler = None
        
    def fit_transform(self, transactions_df: pd.DataFrame, 
                     users_df: pd.DataFrame = None) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """
        Fit feature engineering pipeline and transform data.
        """
```

### 2. Implement Behavioral Features
- **User Velocity Features**:
  - Transaction count in last 1h, 6h, 24h, 7d, 30d
  - Unique merchants visited in time windows
  - Geographic spread (unique locations)
  - Device switching frequency
  
- **Amount Pattern Features**:
  - Amount relative to user's average
  - Amount relative to merchant average
  - Sudden spike detection
  - Round amount indicators
  
- **Time-based Features**:
  - Hour of day (cyclic encoding)
  - Day of week patterns
  - Holiday/weekend indicators
  - Time since last transaction
  - Transaction frequency patterns

### 3. Create Advanced Aggregation Features
```python
def create_rolling_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame, 
                          windows: List[str] = ['1H', '6H', '1D', '7D', '30D']) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Create rolling window statistics for each user.
    """
    
def create_user_profile_features(self, transactions_df: pd.DataFrame, 
                               users_df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Create user-level behavioral profile features.
    """
```

### 4. Implement Risk Score Features
- **Merchant Risk Score**: Based on historical fraud rates
- **Location Risk Score**: Geographic fraud probability
- **Device Risk Score**: Device type fraud patterns
- **Time Risk Score**: Hour/day fraud likelihood
- **Network Features**: User-merchant graph statistics

### 5. Add Feature Interaction Pipeline
```python
def create_interaction_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame, 
                              interactions: List[Tuple[str, str]]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Create polynomial and ratio features from feature interactions.
    """
```

### 6. Implement Feature Selection Methods
```python
def select_features(self, X: pd.DataFrame, y: pd.Series, 
                   method: str = 'mutual_info', 
                   top_k: int = 50) -> List[str]:
    """
    Select most important features using various methods.
    """
```

fe = FeatureEngineer(config={'enable_advanced': True})

# Fit and transform
features_df = fe.fit_transform(
    transactions_df=transactions,
    users_df=users
)

# Get feature importance
importance = fe.get_feature_importance(
    X=features_df,
    y=labels,
    method='permutation'
)

# Real-time feature generation
real_time_features = fe.transform_single_transaction(
    transaction=new_transaction,
    user_history=user_transactions
