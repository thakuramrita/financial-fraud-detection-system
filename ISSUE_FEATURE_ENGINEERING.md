# Issue: Implement Comprehensive Feature Engineering Pipeline

## Summary
Develop a robust and scalable feature engineering pipeline for the Financial Fraud Detection System to create high-quality, domain-specific features that improve model performance and capture complex fraud patterns.

## Background
The current system generates synthetic fraud data with basic transaction features, but lacks sophisticated feature engineering capabilities. The `src/features/` directory exists but is empty, indicating a critical gap in the ML pipeline. Advanced feature engineering is essential for detecting complex fraud patterns that simple transaction features cannot capture.

## Problem Statement
- **Limited Feature Set**: Current features are basic and don't capture temporal, behavioral, or relational patterns
- **No Feature Engineering Pipeline**: Missing automated feature creation, selection, and validation
- **Scalability Issues**: Manual feature creation doesn't scale for production environments
- **Feature Drift**: No monitoring or retraining mechanisms for feature stability
- **Domain Knowledge Gap**: Missing financial domain-specific features that fraud analysts rely on

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Create Core Feature Engineering Framework
```python
class FraudFeatureEngineer:
    def __init__(self, config: FeatureConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.feature_registry = {}
        self.feature_metadata = {}
    
    def create_temporal_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Create time-based features (hour, day, seasonality, etc.)"""
    
    def create_behavioral_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Create user behavior patterns and anomalies"""
    
    def create_aggregation_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Create rolling statistics and aggregations"""
    
    def create_interaction_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Create feature interactions and ratios"""
    
    def create_domain_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Create financial domain-specific features"""
```

### 2. Implement Temporal Feature Engineering
- **Time-based Features**: Hour of day, day of week, month, quarter, holidays
- **Seasonality**: Weekly, monthly, yearly patterns
- **Time Windows**: Rolling statistics over different time periods
- **Lag Features**: Previous transaction patterns and amounts
- **Velocity Features**: Transaction frequency and timing anomalies

### 3. Create Behavioral Feature Engineering
- **User Profiling**: Average amounts, transaction patterns, preferred merchants
- **Anomaly Detection**: Deviation from user's normal behavior
- **Risk Scoring**: User-level risk indicators based on history
- **Network Features**: Social network analysis (if applicable)
- **Device Patterns**: Device usage patterns and anomalies

### 4. Implement Aggregation Features
- **Rolling Statistics**: Mean, std, min, max over sliding windows
- **Cumulative Features**: Running totals and averages
- **Ratio Features**: Amount ratios, frequency ratios
- **Percentile Features**: Amount percentiles, timing percentiles
- **Cross-Entity Aggregations**: Merchant-level, category-level statistics

### 5. Add Domain-Specific Financial Features
- **Velocity Fraud Indicators**: Multiple transactions in short time
- **Geographic Anomalies**: Distance from usual locations
- **Amount Patterns**: Unusual amounts, round numbers, micro-transactions
- **Merchant Risk**: High-risk merchant categories and patterns
- **Card Usage Patterns**: Card type, issuer, international usage

### 6. Create Feature Selection and Validation
```python
class FeatureSelector:
    def __init__(self, method: str = 'shap'):
        self.method = method
    
    def select_features(self, X: pd.DataFrame, y: pd.Series) -> List[str]:
        """Select best features using multiple methods"""
    
    def validate_features(self, X: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Validate feature quality and stability"""
    
    def detect_feature_drift(self, X_train: pd.DataFrame, X_test: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Detect feature distribution drift"""
```
