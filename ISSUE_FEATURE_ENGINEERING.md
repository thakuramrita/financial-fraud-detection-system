# Issue: Implement Advanced Feature Engineering Pipeline for Fraud Detection

## Summary
Develop a comprehensive feature engineering pipeline that transforms raw transaction and user data into sophisticated features for enhanced fraud detection performance across all ML models.

## Background
The current fraud detection system generates synthetic transaction data with basic features but lacks advanced feature engineering capabilities. The main.py file references `src/features/feature_engineering.py` which doesn't exist yet, indicating a critical gap in the data preprocessing pipeline.

## Problem Statement
- **Missing Feature Engineering Module**: The referenced `feature_engineering.py` file doesn't exist
- **Basic Feature Set**: Current data only includes raw transaction attributes without derived features
- **No Temporal Features**: Missing time-based patterns crucial for fraud detection
- **Limited Behavioral Features**: No user behavior profiling or pattern recognition
- **No Interaction Features**: Missing feature combinations that could reveal fraud patterns
- **Performance Gap**: ML models are likely underperforming due to insufficient feature engineering

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Core Feature Engineering Pipeline
```python
class FraudFeatureEngineer:
    """
    Comprehensive feature engineering pipeline for fraud detection.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any] = None):
        """Initialize with configurable parameters."""
        
    def fit_transform(self, transactions_df: pd.DataFrame, users_df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Main pipeline to generate all features."""
        
    def transform(self, transactions_df: pd.DataFrame, users_df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Transform new data using fitted parameters."""
```

### 2. Advanced Feature Categories

#### A. Temporal Features
- **Time-based patterns**: Hour of day, day of week, month seasonality
- **Velocity features**: Transaction frequency in last 1H, 24H, 7D, 30D
- **Time since last transaction**: Per user, per merchant, per device
- **Transaction sequence analysis**: Order patterns, timing irregularities

#### B. Behavioral Features
- **User spending patterns**: Average amount, spending distribution, typical merchants
- **Deviation detection**: How far current transaction deviates from user norm
- **Merchant interaction**: New vs. familiar merchants, merchant risk scores
- **Device behavior**: Device switching patterns, location consistency

#### C. Aggregation Features
- **Rolling statistics**: Mean, median, std, min, max over various time windows
- **Cumulative features**: Total spending, transaction count, fraud history
- **Percentile features**: Where current transaction stands in user's history
- **Category aggregations**: Spending by merchant category, location patterns

#### D. Interaction Features
- **Amount-Time interactions**: Large amounts at unusual times
- **Location-Merchant interactions**: Unusual merchant-location combinations
- **User-Device interactions**: Device mismatch patterns
- **Categorical combinations**: High-risk category + location + time combinations

#### E. Risk Score Features
- **Merchant risk scores**: Based on historical fraud rates
- **Location risk scores**: Geographic fraud hotspots
- **Device risk scores**: Device-based fraud patterns
- **Composite risk scores**: Weighted combinations of multiple risk factors

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### Feature Generation Methods
```python
def generate_temporal_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Generate time-based features."""
    
def generate_behavioral_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Generate user behavior features."""
    
def generate_aggregation_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Generate rolling and cumulative features."""
    
def generate_interaction_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Generate feature interactions."""
    
def generate_risk_scores(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Generate risk-based features."""
```

#### Feature Selection and Optimization
```python
def select_features(self, X: pd.DataFrame, y: pd.Series, method: str = 'mutual_info') -> List[str]:
    """Select most informative features."""
    
def optimize_feature_types(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Optimize data types for memory efficiency."""
    
def handle_missing_values(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Handle missing values in features."""
```

### 4. Integration with ML Pipeline

#### Update Model Training
```python
# In train_models.py
from src.features.feature_engineering import FraudFeatureEngineer

def load_and_prepare_data(self):
    """Enhanced data loading with feature engineering."""
    # Load raw data
    transactions_df = pd.read_csv('data/transactions.csv')
    users_df = pd.read_csv('data/users.csv')
    
    # Apply feature engineering
    feature_engineer = FraudFeatureEngineer()
    features_df = feature_engineer.fit_transform(transactions_df, users_df)
    
    return features_df.drop('is_fraud', axis=1), features_df['is_fraud']
```

#### Real-time Feature Generation
```python
def generate_realtime_features(self, transaction: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Generate features for real-time prediction."""
```
